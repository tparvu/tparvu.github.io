"I would like personally to end this way.  I've witnessed one miracle
after another through my whole life, extraordinary things happening.  I
see that God tries very hard and apparently is intent to make us a
success if it is possible.  So if we don't make it, it is because of
each individual.  You can't leave it to your politicians to represent
you; you can't leave it to your ministers to pray for you.  It's going
to be how each individual reacts in relation to the truth."
