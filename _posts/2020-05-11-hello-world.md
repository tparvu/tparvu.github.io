I decided today that I wanted to create my [GitHub.io](https://tparvu.github.io) site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as the static site generator.
My main sources were [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) and [Jekyll's docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

Using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com), and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) together is a great way to manage web site development.

You are able to use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [HTML](https://whatwg.org/), [templates](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/), [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html), and much more.

With Jekyll you are also able to build a static website and [deploy](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment/) as you see fit. Jekyll also allows you to render your changes locally, quickly, and easily.
