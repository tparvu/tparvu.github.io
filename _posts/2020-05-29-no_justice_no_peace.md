After days of watching the protests in Minneapolis we were very worried about what we would wake up to this morning.
With the National Guard and State Police joining the fray, anything could happen.
People of good conscience in the U.S. have had enough. 
We simply are not going to stand by idly any longer. 

We can not, and will not.

Make no mistake, there are very good reasons that police around the country are the focal point of the people's frustration and anger.

That cops like Derek Chauvin are able to remain on the force for nearly two decades demonstrates how rotten our police forces are.
This isn't a Minneapolis issue, this is a U.S. issue.
We have police forces around the country chock full of haters whose real role is to keep the lower tiers of our society in line.
They are our modern day slave overseers.

Make no mistake, George Floyd was lynched as you can see in the video taken by brave witnesses.

If you are a cop, and you have a good conscience, how could you allow this asshole to stay on the force?

Why has he not been arrested?

Why are you still protecting him?

It is time for all good people to stand up for what is right.

Our cities are burning because we have been left no peaceful manner in which to affect change in our society.

If you are high enough up in the social hierarchy, you might be surprised by our methods, but we are fighting for you to.
Make no mistake, the rich are getting richer, and you are getting poorer, and soon enough, you will have a boot on your neck.

If you do not understand why this is our only avenue left then you should examine your own privilege.
I have privilege, and I know it, and I am using it to help the good people of our country as I am able.
If you believe that all people are created equal, then you need to start demonstrating it.

We are all in this together, we have two possible paths now.
We can help each other out or those at the top can order their lackeys to crack down even harder.
If we want peace, we must address the long standing tyranny in our country.

If you are scared, you should be.
You need to reflect on why you are scared.
What is it exactly that you are afraid of?
Are you on the right side of this conflict?

Until the U.S. has an egalitarian society there will be no peace.
The U.S. President has [threatened to start shooting people](https://theintercept.com/2020/05/29/twitter-restricts-access-trumps-threat-shoot-minneapolis-protesters/) and that will certainly make the situation much worse.
We have come to expect no less from the _Divider in Chief_.

So what's it going to be?

Are we going to address the long standing issue of inequality in our country for real or are we going to continue down this doomed course until there is nothing left but a burnt out and smoking shell?

The choice is ours to make.
